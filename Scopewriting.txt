Scope Of Project:
The COMPUTER VISUAL INTELLIGENCE (CVI) software returns set of five images
from a large database, in response to a user image query or user's text
query through the technique of convolutional neural network. a training
data set of 50 images is stored in the CVI to train convolutional neural
network for classifying these 50 images into 10 categories. each category
will be stored as separate dataset in the s/w.
